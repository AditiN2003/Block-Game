### Sliding Block Puzzle Game in Java

This repository contains a Java implementation of a sliding block puzzle game. The project comprises three main classes: Block, Board, and GridUtil, which form the core logic of the game.

Key Features:
Block Class: Represents blocks on the game board, enabling movement and resetting of block positions.
Board Class: Manages the game state, 2D grid of cells, block manipulation, and provides functionality for game resets and move validations.
GridUtil Class: Facilitates the conversion of string-based board descriptions into 2D arrays of cells and block lists.
